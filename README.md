📦 Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

👩🏽‍🍳 Features:
This project is a two-player game that dynamically updates the score for each player based on the number shown when the dice is rolled. It concludes by displaying the winning player between player1 and player2.

💭 Process:
The development process involved creating a function triggered when the DOM is loaded to set the game to its starting point, prompting me to consider more effective ways of manipulating displayed page elements.

Subsequently, a function was needed to switch between active players, leading to a deeper dive into DOM manipulation.

The challenge then shifted to creating a rolling dice functionality with a variable holding a random number from 1 to 6. A search on Google provided insights into generating random numbers, which were successfully implemented.

Displaying the corresponding image of the dice number and handling scenarios where the number is 1 required additional logic.

The project also necessitated a function to store accumulated points for a user deciding to hold their result, which became more straightforward with the acquired knowledge of manipulating classes.

📚 Learnings:
This project heightened my understanding of DOM manipulation and refined my skills in this area. It introduced concepts such as ternary operators and event listeners, marking my initial use of these in a project. Additionally, I gained insights into the functions within the Math library, particularly the Math.random() method.

✨ Improvement:
A potential improvement could involve implementing a feature that requests usernames for both players. Additionally, storing the winner's username along with the difference by which they won the game and displaying this information in a table could enhance the overall user experience.
